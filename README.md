# Crytocurrency and Darknet Taxonomies

This directory contains taxonomies covering common types of entities found in Darknet and Cryptocurrency Ecosystems, as well as abusive, possibly criminal behaviors found in real-world investigations.

Concept definitions follow the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/).

For readability, and low-barrier bootsprapping, all taxonomies follow the YAML format proposed by [SKOUT](https://github.com/marcelotto/skout).

## How to convert from YAML to a defined SKOS serialization format

Make sure SKOUT is installed
